If you're Rh-negative, you'll get a shot of Rh immune globulin (Rhogam) at least once during your pregnancy, and another after you give birth if your baby turns out to be Rh-positive.",
        texttwo: "This shot will protect you from developing antibodies that could be dangerous during this pregnancy or (more likely) in future pregnancies. These antibodies attack fetal red blood cells, causing fetal anemia.",

An elevated number of white blood cells could indicate an infection, and the number of platelets can tell if there's a problem with blood clotting.",

        texttwo: "If a woman is infected with rubella for the first time during pregnancy, the rubella virus can cause a miscarriage, preterm birth, or stillbirth, as well as a variety of serious birth defects, depending on how far along you are when you contract the virus. So if you aren't immune, it's very important to avoid anyone who has the infection and forgo travel to foreign countries where the disease is still prevalent.",

Most women of reproductive age in the United States have received the hepatitis B vaccine as children and teens and so are immune.",

You should be tested for syphilis three times during pregnancy: at your first prenatal visit, in the third trimester, and at delivery. If you have syphilis and don't treat it, both you and your baby could develop serious problems. You should be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea if you are under age 25 or if you are at increased risk for getting STIs.",

It happens to 1 or 2 babies out of 100 when the mother does not receive treatment with antibiotics during labor. The chance of a newborn getting sick is much lower when the mother receives treatment.The test for GBS is called a culture. It is done between 36 and 38 weeks of pregnancy. For this test, a swab is used to take a sample from the vagina and rectum.",
        textthree: "Even though it is rare for a baby to get GBS, it can be very serious when it happens. A small number of babies with GBS die even with immediate treatment.If the results show that GBS is present, antibiotics should be given through an intravenous (IV) line once labor has started. This is done to help protect the fetus from being infected. The best time for treatment is during labor."
