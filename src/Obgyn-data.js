        text: "Though it's by far an exact science, and every pregnancy is different, there are guidelines you can follow to track your pregnancy weight by week and by trimester so you know the general pace you can expect to follow.",
        texttwo: "But keep in mind that there's a wide range of normal when it comes to gaining weight during pregnancy. Rather than obsessing over pregnancy weight gain at home, your best bet is to go to all your prenatal doctor's appointments and make sure things are progressing as they should. Always check in with your health care provider if you have any questions or concerns about your weight gain.",
        textthree: "Ever wonder where the pregnancy weight goes? It may feel like it’s all in your belly, but that’s not actually the case. For a 30-pound pregnancy weight gain, this weight breaksdown between a baby, placenta, amniotic fluid, maternal breast tissue, increased maternal blood volume, fluids in maternal tissue and maternal fat stores.",
        textfour: "You need to gain weight in all these areas to have a healthy baby and pregnancy, and to prepare your body for breastfeeding if you’re planning on doing so."

        text: "TThe fetal heart rate is the number of times your baby's heart beats per minute – how fast it's beating. A handheld Doppler device is what your doctor or midwife will use to check your baby's heart rate at your prenatal visits. ",
        texttwo: "Your baby's heart beats much faster than that of an older child or adult. Most experts consider between 110 and 160 bpm (beats per minute) to be a normal fetal heart rate through most of pregnancy.Very early on – between 8 weeks and 10 weeks pregnant – the range is higher, between 150 and 170 bpm.",
        textthree: "But the rate doesn't stay the same. It changes throughout pregnancy and even throughout the day sometimes. A shift of 5 to 25 beats per minute is perfectly normal.",
        textfour: "You may have heard that a fetus' heart rate can tell you whether you're having a boy or girl, because girls have a faster heart rate than boys. But science doesn't back this up, at least in early pregnancy.",

        title: "Measuring your abdomen to check baby's growth",
        text: "Fundal height is the distance between the top of your uterus and your pubic bone. Healthcare providers use it to measure if fetal growth is on track. Fundal height in centimeters should be close to the number of weeks you are in pregnancy, plus or minus 2 centimeters. However, this is only the case from about weeks 20 to 36. If the fetus measures smaller or larger than average, an ultrasound may be needed to get a more accurate size.",
        texttwo: "Fundal height is one of the simplest and least invasive tools for tracking your baby's growth. It can be the first indication of growth problems or problems with your baby's position. Your healthcare provider will order an ultrasound if your fundal height is concerning. Ultrasounds are more accurate at predicting your baby's size, but are only recommended two times during pregnancy (unless medically necessary).",
        textthree: "Fundal height tells your healthcare provider important things about your baby's size, growth and position in your uterus. It helps confirm that your baby is growing as they should. It can also tell them how much amniotic fluid is in your uterus. Too little or too much amniotic fluid can indicate a problem.",

        textthree: "Depending on your health and risk factors, your provider might recommend some additional blood tests to screen for possible complications or fetal abnormalities. Together, you can decide on the right amount of testing for you.",
        textfour: "Pregnancy blood tests are safe and unlikely to cause any major side effects. But the needle might pinch a little bit, and you might have some mild, temporary bruising at the site of the injection."
