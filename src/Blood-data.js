        text: "At your first prenatal visit, your practitioner will check your blood type to see whether it's type O, A, B, or AB, and whether it's Rh-negative. If you're Rh-negative (15 percent of people are), you'll get a shot of Rh immune globulin (Rhogam) at least once during your pregnancy, and another after you give birth if your baby turns out to be Rh-positive.",
        texttwo: "This shot will protect you from developing antibodies that could be dangerous during this pregnancy or (more likely) in future pregnancies. (In your first pregnancy, your body will make only a small number of antibodies, which may not cause a problem. In later pregnancies, your body will make more.) These antibodies attack fetal red blood cells, causing fetal anemia.",

(An elevated number of white blood cells could indicate an infection, and the number of platelets can tell if there's a problem with blood clotting.)",

        text: "This test, called a rubella titer, checks the level of antibodies to the rubella virus in your blood to see whether you're immune. Most women are immune to rubella, either because they've been vaccinated (with the MMR vaccine) or, (more unlikely), had the disease as a child.",
        texttwo: "If a woman is infected with rubella for the first time during pregnancy, the rubella virus can cause a miscarriage, preterm birth, or stillbirth, as well as a variety of serious birth defects, depending on how far along you are when you contract the virus. So if you aren't immune (either because you never received the vaccine, or its effect waned), it's very important to avoid anyone who has the infection and forgo travel to foreign countries where the disease is still prevalent.",

Most women of reproductive age in the United States have received the hepatitis B vaccine as children and teens and so are immune.",
        texttwo: "If you're a hepatitis B carrier, your practitioner will protect your baby by giving them an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin as well as their first shot of the hep B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. (Your baby will get the second shot at 1 or 2 months and the third at 6 months.) All members of your household should be tested and vaccinated if you're a carrier. Most babies receive their first hepatitis B vaccine within the first month of life, regardless.",

Given the test results and time, your doctors can greatly reduce the risk of transmission to your baby.

While a GBS infection does not usually cause problems in women before pregnancy, it can cause serious illness in mothers during pregnancy. GBS may cause chorioamnionitis (a severe infection of the placental tissues) and postpartum infection. Urinary tract infections caused by GBS can lead to preterm labor and birth or pyelonephritis and sepsis",

The treatment of mothers with certain risk factors or positive cultures is important to reduce the risk of transmission of GBS to the baby. Babies whose mothers receive antibiotic treatment for a positive GBS test are 20 times less likely to develop the disease than those without treatment."
