It screens all 23 chromosome pairs, reporting aneuploidies, large deletions and duplications greater than 7 Mb in addition to select microdeletions2. Genome-wide NIPT screens for a range of other chromosome abnormalities that can occur in pregnancy, covering all chromosomes except the X and Y chromosomes3",

If you're a carrier, that means your DNA contains a genetic mutation that's associated with a disease, even though you may not have the condition yourself. If both you and your partner are carriers, and you both pass the genetic mutation along to your baby, the baby could end up with the disease.",

        results: "Vistara is the most comprehensive prenatal single-gene screening test for serious genetic conditions. These conditions, which affect quality of life, could benefit from early intervention and might otherwise go undetected. Vistara tests for 25 serious genetic conditions with a blood draw from the mother. Most results will be returned to a clinician within 2-3 weeks.Vistara is a screening test, which means that Vistara does not make a final diagnosis. A screen-positive Vistara result means that a pregnancy could be affected by the condition that has screened positive. However, it cannot be known for sure if a baby has that condition based upon screening results alone. ",

        results: "A sample of some of the placental tissue that is obtained during CVS contains the same genetic material as the fetus and can be tested for chromosomal abnormalities and some other genetic problems. Testing is available for other genetic defects and disorders, depending on your family history and the availability of lab testing at the time of the procedure. Unlike amniocentesis, CVS does not provide information on open neural tube defects. Therefore, women who undergo CVS also need a follow-up blood test between 16 and 18 weeks of pregnancy to screen for these defects. CVS may be offered to women with an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities or who have a family history of a genetic defect that is testable from the placental tissue.",
